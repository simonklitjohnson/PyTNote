PyTNote (Python Terminal Notes) is a simple note manager for your terminal.
It allows you to quickly and easily create and manage notes without ever leaving your terminal workflow.

Creating a new note is as simple as typing "note Remember to update readme".

Stay on top of your productivity with PyTNote!

This software has no license, so do whatever you want to with it. I'd prefer it if you didn't sell it though.

## Installing
### macOS and Linux
Installing PyTNote on macOS and Linux distributions is as simple as running the following one-liner in your terminal:

`curl -o note https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonklitjohnson/PyTNote/master/note.py && chmod +x note && mv note /usr/local/bin`

### Windows
I do not have a Windows machine, but I suppose you can pretty easily find a guide on how to make a python file executable in cmd on Windows somewhere.
